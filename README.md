# Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting Using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) Models

I have prepared an in-depth research study on cryptocurrency price forecasting using the GRU model. In it, you will find a detailed explanation of the theoretical foundations, methodology, and practical application of this technology.
Key sections of the research:

Theoretical foundations of GRU: architecture, operating principles, and comparison with LSTM
Specifics of the cryptocurrency market: data characteristics and key influencing factors
Application methodology: complete cycle from problem formulation to results interpretation
Data preparation: preprocessing, feature engineering, and sequence formation
Model building and optimization: architecture, hyperparameters, and combating overfitting
Practical implementation: complete Python code example with comments
Comparison with other methods: traditional statistical and other neural network approaches
Limitations and prospects: honest assessment of fundamental limitations and development directions

The research contains practical code examples, mathematical formulas, visualizations, and recommendations that will help you apply GRU models for cryptocurrency price forecasting.
This material will be useful for both researchers and practitioners interested in applying deep learning to crypto trading.
